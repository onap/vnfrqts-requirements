      "message": "While this looks better than previous links, it is still not clear URLs are permanent and official. The repository description states \u0027Trial SA5 - data models\u0027 and the following warning is found on the main page:\n\nImportant note: This repository serves as a trial for 3GPP SA5 WG adoption. The current name, structure and address (i.e. URL) of the repository may change at the end of the trial period.\n \nIndeed I believe there was an endorsed proposal (S5-204480) in the last SA5 meeting that included repository renaming in turn impacting URLs.\n\nLooking at the YAML files themselves there appear to be a number of inconsistencies for notification definitions. However they do seem to match version of 28.532 approved in SA88.\nThe most serious thing I noticed yet is heartbeatNtf.yaml which probably will not work at all, due to notificationType field definition. (The root cause is really re-use of header from other MnS which seems like a bad idea.)",
