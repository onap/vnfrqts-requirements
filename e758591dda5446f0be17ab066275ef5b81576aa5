      "message": "Given that DCAE has to be pre-configured with the schemas, and will have default schemas already onboarded.  I\u0027m questioning these requirements. Based on a conversation with Vijay, DCAE will reject a stndDefined event that has an unknown schemaReference value.  That means we have mandatory requirements here - not recommendations.\n\nThe set of valid schemaReference field values MUST be a value registered with DCAE in advance in the schema-map.json file. \n\nI\u0027d rather not have have to keep track of the valid values in two places so can we just link the schema-map.json and create requirements to the effect of the following...\n\n* The VNF or PNF producing VES stndDefined domain events **MUST** only pass events that conform to schema references previously registered with DCAE otherwise the event will be rejected. By default, ONAP ships with support for schemas found here (link to schema-map.json).\n\n* The VNF or PNF producing VES stndDefined domain events **MUST** set the schemaReference value to the publicUrl value in DCAE\u0027s schema-map.json file (link) that describes the data being sent in event.stndDefinedFields.data.\n\n* The VNF or PNF Provider producing stndDefined events **MUST** coordinate with the operator to configure DCAE to accept any new event schemas prior to sending those events or the events will be rejected.\n\n\nThe VNF Requirements project exists to define what an NF needs to do to integrate with ONAP.  If we make this simply about what DCAE supports, then we can avoid the timing issues in 3GPP and more easily keep the VNF Requirements in sync with what ONAP supports.  DCAE can evolve what it supports and we don\u0027t have to keep the requirements in sync.",

      "message": "While this looks better than previous links, it is still not clear URLs are permanent and official. The repository description states \u0027Trial SA5 - data models\u0027 and the following warning is found on the main page:\n\nImportant note: This repository serves as a trial for 3GPP SA5 WG adoption. The current name, structure and address (i.e. URL) of the repository may change at the end of the trial period.\n \nIndeed I believe there was an endorsed proposal (S5-204480) in the last SA5 meeting that included repository renaming in turn impacting URLs.\n\nLooking at the YAML files themselves there appear to be a number of inconsistencies for notification definitions. However they do seem to match version of 28.532 approved in SA88.\nThe most serious thing I noticed yet is heartbeatNtf.yaml which probably will not work at all, due to notificationType field definition. (The root cause is really re-use of header from other MnS which seems like a bad idea.)",

      "message": "The code freeze for ONAP\u0027s Guilin release is this week.  We\u0027ll have some flexibility to resolve issues after that time, but when will the URLs for the schemas be finalized?  If this will remain beyond our Guilin timeline, then I would suggest we remove the links and refer to them by name.  However to do that, we we need to understand what ONAP has consumed in Guilin (i.e. has DCAE copied in versions of these schemas that could still be changed).  If DCAE has consumed schemas, then this presents a larger challenge unless the finalization of the schemas in 3GPP is imminent. Who can confirm both items?  1) when will these be published in 3GPP (final, static URLs) and 2) what has ONAP consumed?\n\nWith regards to the concern about heartbeatNtf.yaml - that sounds like it needs to be worked in 3GPP.

Who can confirm both items?  1) when will these be published in 3GPP (final, static URLs) and 2) what has ONAP consumed?\n\nAnswering 1) How I understand this is that for now official publishing in 3GPP is via TS documents, so etsi forge is on best effort and changes like creation of permanent URLs are done via ETSI MCC, so only way to speed this is that all companies via they 3GPP delegates complain to 3GPP.\n\nAnswering 2) This is much simpler to answer.  The mentioned file are pre-loaded in DCA but can be change any time.\n\n\u003e With regards to the concern about heartbeatNtf.yaml - that sounds like it needs to be worked in 3GPP.

The 2 requirements (R-408814, R-408815) are saying that you need to provide reference to exact data definition and later provide data which match this reference. Additionally second requirement inform that the linked definitions are \"built-in\". This information can be also provided as a pointer to 3GPP appendix or we can include whole files in requirements, we perceive those as less effective.\nDo you see any issues in proposed requirements text which can be solve by changing the text?",
