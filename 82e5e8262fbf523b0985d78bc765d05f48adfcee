Maybe we can confirm with the team on the daily call if we need to introduce a new target or if all VNF Package targets should simply be XNF Package.\n\nIf we don\u0027t know the impacts, then we can exclude it vs. including None.  \n\nvalidation_mode would be static since we\u0027re validating the package.  The validation_mode isn\u0027t meant to imply if a test case exists or not - just how it would be validated when written.\n\nintroduced should be all lower case.
