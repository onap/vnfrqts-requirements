The field deifnition wasn`t changed, it is still a string (and it stays a string). What changes is, that we start to validate thw format of that string, but within the VES spec, we already tell,that the field shall contain an OAM IP address (IPv4 or IPv6 respectively). I am not sure, if we really need updates in VES spec. Within the schema, we actually start to validate, if the contents are aligned with VES spec...",
