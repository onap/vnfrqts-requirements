      "message": "Since the registration field definitions are being changed, a new version number should be added. Formally the change above is not backwards comaptible since it introduces additional constraints in the schema regarding valid values. However in this case it is already assumed that these fields would contain correctly formatted IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, so it may be ok to use patch version number like 2.0.1.",
