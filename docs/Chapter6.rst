**6. Infrastructure Requirements**
=====================================

This Amsterdam release of the requirements is targeted for those implementations that consist of Network Clouds: Vanilla OpenStack (based on Ocata_) and commercial Clouds for example: OpenStack (including `Titanium - Mitaka from Wind River`_ and `VIO - Ocata from VMware`_). Future versions of ONAP are envisioned to include other targeted cloud infrastructure implementations, for example, on-premise private cloud, public cloud, or hybrid cloud implementations, and related network backends, e.g. `Microsoft Azure`_ et al.
