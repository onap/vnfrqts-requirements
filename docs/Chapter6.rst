**6. Infrastructure Requirements**
=====================================

a. OpenStack
There are no infrastructure requirements for VNF Design Time operations as VNF requirements are agnostic to the underlying infrastructure.  Specific cloud and management systems are required for the purpose of validation and verification of VNFs as required for the VNF Validation Program (VPP). One such management system is OpenStack which is supported by the ONAP Platform Amsterdam release.
#. Azure
Support for Microsoft's Azure Cloud Computing Platform will be addressed in future versions of the document.
