Purpose
=======

- The purpose of these requirements is to accelerate adoption of VNF or PNF
  best practices which will increase innovation, minimize customization needed
  to onboard VNFs or PNFs as well as reduce implementation complexity, time and
  cost for all impacted stakeholders.
- The consolidated requirements provide common VNF or PNF requirements across
  the industry in order to drive interoperability, simplify management, and
  reduce cost to build, deploy and manage VNFs or PNFs.
- These requirements serve multiple purposes:
    - Primarily it provides a detailed list of requirements for VNF or PNF
      providers to meet to be compatible with ONAP; VNF or PNF providers will
      use the VNF or PNF requirements to build VNFs/PNFs that are compatible
      with ONAP.
    - It can also serve as a list of requirements that service providers can
      use in RFPs for selecting VNFs/PNFs.
    - It will also be used as a basis for testing and certification of
      VNFs or PNFs for compliance with ONAP; ONAP projects such as the VNF
      Validation Project will uses these VNFs or PNFs requirements to build
      test cases to validate VNFs or PNFs for compliance with ONAP.
