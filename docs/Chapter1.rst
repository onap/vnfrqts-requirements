**1. Purpose**
==============
- The purpose of these requirements is to accelerate adoption of VNF best practices which will increase innovation, minimize customization needed to onboard VNFs as well as reduce implementation complexity, time and cost for all impacted stakeholders.
- This initial release consolidates the requirements from Open-O and OpenECOMP to provide common VNF requirements across the industry in order to drive interoperability, simplify management, and reduce cost to build, deploy and manage VNFs.
- These requirements serve multiple purposes:
    - Primarily it provides a detailed list of requirements for VNF providers to meet to be compatible with ONAP; VNF providers will use the VNF requirements to build VNFs that are compatible with ONAP.
    - It can also serve as a list of requirements that service providers can use in RFPs for selecting VNFs.
    - It will also be used as a basis for testing and certification of VNFs for compliance with ONAP; ONAP projects such as the VNF Validation Project will uses these VNFs requirements to build test cases to validate VNFs for compliance with ONAP.
