**Purpose**
==============
- The purpose of these requirements is to accelerate adoption of VNF/PNF best
  practices which will increase innovation, minimize customization needed to
  onboard VNFs/PNFs as well as reduce implementation complexity, time and cost
  for all impacted stakeholders.
- This initial release consolidates the requirements from Open-O and OpenECOMP
  to provide common VNF/PNF requirements across the industry in order to drive
  interoperability, simplify management, and reduce cost to build, deploy and
  manage VNFs/PNFs.
- These requirements serve multiple purposes:
    - Primarily it provides a detailed list of requirements for VNF/PNF
      providers to meet to be compatible with ONAP; VNF/PNF providers will use
      the VNF/PNF requirements to build VNFs/PNFs that are compatible with ONAP
    - It can also serve as a list of requirements that service providers can
      use in RFPs for selecting VNFs/PNFs
    - It will also be used as a basis for testing and certification of
      VNFs/PNFs for compliance with ONAP; ONAP projects such as the VNF
      Validation Project will uses these VNFs/PNFs requirements to build test
      cases to validate VNFs/PNFs for compliance with ONAP.
