**Purpose**
==============
- The purpose of these requirements is to accelerate adoption of xNF best
  practices which will increase innovation, minimize customization needed to
  onboard xNFs as well as reduce implementation complexity, time and cost
  for all impacted stakeholders.
- This initial release consolidates the requirements from Open-O and OpenECOMP
  to provide common xNF requirements across the industry in order to drive
  interoperability, simplify management, and reduce cost to build, deploy and
  manage xNFs.
- These requirements serve multiple purposes:
    - Primarily it provides a detailed list of requirements for xNF
      providers to meet to be compatible with ONAP; xNF providers will use
      the xNF requirements to build VNFs/PNFs that are compatible with ONAP
    - It can also serve as a list of requirements that service providers can
      use in RFPs for selecting VNFs/PNFs
    - It will also be used as a basis for testing and certification of
      xNFs for compliance with ONAP; ONAP projects such as the VNF
      Validation Project will uses these xNFs requirements to build test
      cases to validate xNFs for compliance with ONAP.
