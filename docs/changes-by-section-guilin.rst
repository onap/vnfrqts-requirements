^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Requirements Changed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-67124`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **MUST** be designed to run
    using an inventory hosts file in a supported format; with group names
    matching VNFC 3-character string adding "vip" for groups with virtual IP
    addresses shared by multiple VMs as seen in examples provided in Appendix.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-94567`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **MUST** be designed to run
    using an inventory hosts file in a supported format with only IP addresses
    or IP addresses and VM/VNF or PNF names.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-24482`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **MUST** be designed to run
    using an inventory hosts file in a supported format; with site group that
    shall be used to add site specific configurations to the target VNF or PNF
    VM(s) as needed.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-82018`

    The VNF or PNF **MUST** load the Ansible Server SSH public key onto VNF or
    PNF VM(s) /root/.ssh/authorized_keys as part of instantiation. Alternative,
    is for Ansible Server SSH public key to be loaded onto VNF or PNF
    under /home/<Mechanized user ID>/.ssh/authorized_keys as part of
    instantiation, when a Mechanized user ID is created during instantiation,
    and Configure and all playbooks are designed to use a mechanized user ID
    only for authentication (never using root authentication during Configure
    playbook run). This will allow the Ansible Server to authenticate to
    perform post-instantiation configuration without manual intervention and
    without requiring specific VNF or PNF login IDs and passwords.

    *CAUTION*: For VNFs or PNFs configured using Ansible, to eliminate the need
    for manual steps, post-instantiation and pre-configuration, to
    upload of SSH public keys, SSH public keys loaded during (heat)
    instantiation shall be preserved and not removed by (heat) embedded
    (userdata) scripts.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-92866`

    The VNF or PNF Provider **MUST** include as part of post-instantiation
    configuration done by Ansible Playbooks the removal/update of the SSH
    public key from ``/root/.ssh/authorized_keys``, and update of SSH keys
    loaded through instantiation to support Ansible. This may include creating
    Mechanized user ID(s) used by the Ansible Server(s) on VNF VM(s) and
    uploading and installing new SSH keys used by the mechanized use ID(s).

Requirements Added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-195620`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **SHOULD** compare the version(s)
    of Ansible that the VNF Provider developed and tested against to the
    ``ansible_version.full`` value during playbook execution, and issue a
    ``WARNING`` message if the operator version is not one of the tested
    versions.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-444446`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **SHOULD** issue log messages
    in the same format as Ansible's default messages:
    ``[<Log Level>]: <message>``

    Example:

       ``[WARNING]: Ansible version 2.9.3 does not match a known,
       tested version: 2.8.1, 2.8.2``
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-918136`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **MUST NOT** fail due to
    a mismatched version check as specified in R-918136. The warning message
    should be issued, and the playbook execution should continue as normal.
    

Requirements Changed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-49911`

    The VNF or PNF Provider **MUST** assign a new point release to the updated
    Ansible playbook set. The functionality of a new playbook set must be
    tested before it is deployed to the production.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-24189`

    The VNF or PNF Provider **MUST** deliver a new set of Ansible playbooks that
    includes all updated and unchanged playbooks for any new revision to an
    existing set of playbooks.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-53245`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **MUST NOT** require
    passwords or secrets to be passed in clear text in the command line or
    Rest API request to run the playbook.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-51442`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **SHOULD** be designed to
    automatically 'rollback' to the original state in case of any errors
    for actions that change state of the VNF or PNF (e.g., configure).

    **Note**: In case rollback at the playbook level is not supported or
    possible, the VNF or PNF provider shall provide alternative rollback
    mechanism (e.g., for a small VNF or PNF the rollback mechanism may rely
    on workflow to terminate and re-instantiate VNF VMs and then re-run
    playbook(s)). Backing up updated files is also recommended to support
    rollback when soft rollback is feasible.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-49396`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **MUST** support each APPC/SDN-C
    VNF or PNF action by invocation of **one** playbook [#7.3.4]_. The playbook
    will be responsible for executing all necessary tasks (as well as calling
    other playbooks) to complete the request.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-50252`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **MUST** write to a response
    file in JSON format that will be retrieved and made available by the
    Ansible Server if, as part of a VNF or PNF action (e.g., audit), a playbook
    is required to return any VNF or PNF information/response. The text files
    must be written in the main playbook home directory, in JSON format. The
    JSON file must be created for the VNF or PNF with the name '<VNF or PNF name>_results.txt'. All playbook
    output results, for all VNF VMS or PNF Server/Blades, to be provided as a
    response to the request, must be written to this response file.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-58301`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **SHOULD NOT** make requests to
    Cloud resources e.g. Openstack (nova, neutron, glance, heat, etc.);
    therefore, there is no use for Cloud specific variables like Openstack
    UUIDs in Ansible Playbook related artifacts.

    **Rationale**: Flows that require interactions with Cloud services e.g.
    Openstack shall rely on workflows run by an Orchestrator
    (Change Management) or other capability (such as a control loop or
    Operations GUI) outside Ansible Server which can be executed by a
    APPC/SDN-C. There are policies, as part of Control Loop
    models, that send remediation action requests to an APPC/SDN-C; these
    are triggered as a response to an event or correlated events published
    to Event Bus.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-09209`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **MUST** store any playbook
    configuration data that requires encryption (passwords, secrets, etc.) in
    a JSON (.json), YAML (.yaml|.yml) or INI (.ini) file, which will be placed
    in ``<VNF type>/<Version>/ansible/vars`` directory.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-46823`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **MUST** store passwords and
    other attributes that must remain secret in JSON, YAML or INI with
    differentiated names when passwords and secrets vary from environment to
    environment. Example, name must include <Mechanized user ID>_...json or
    <Mechanized user ID>_...xml when labs and production use different passwords
    and/or secrets. The <Mechanized user ID> is discovered from the environment
    ``/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`` where the playbook runs.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-48698`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **MUST** utilize information
    from key value pairs that will be provided by the Ansible Server as
    ``extra-vars`` during invocation to execute the desired VNF or PNF action.
    The "extra-vars" attribute-value pairs are passed to the Ansible Server by
    an APPC/SDN-C as part of the Rest API request. If the playbook requires
    files, they must also be supplied using the methodology detailed in the
    Ansible Server API, unless they are bundled with playbooks, example,
    generic templates. Any files containing instance specific info
    (attribute-value pairs), not obtainable
    from any ONAP inventory databases or other sources, referenced and used as
    input by playbooks, shall be provisioned (and distributed) in advance of
    use, e.g., VNF or PNF instantiation. Recommendation is to avoid these
    instance specific, manually created in advance of instantiation, files.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-83092`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **MUST** load passwords
    and other attributes that must remain secret from JSON, YAML or INI files
    that can be encrypted/decrypted using Ansible Vault capabilities.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-39003`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **MUST** store passwords and
    other attributes that must remain secret in JSON, YAML or INI files that
    can be encrypted/decrypted using Ansible Vault capabilities.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-43253`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **MUST** be designed to allow
    Ansible Server to infer failure or success based on the "PLAY_RECAP"
    capability.

    **Note**: There are cases where playbooks need to interpret results
    of a task and then determine success or failure and return result
    accordingly (failure for failed tasks).
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-78640`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **SHOULD** provide a single
    YAML or JSON file with all the passwords and secrets to reduce the number
    of files to be decrypted/encrypted before on-boarding into the central
    repository.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-20988`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **MUST** not log or
    display passwords and other attributes that must remain secret when
    running playbook in debug mode.

    NOTE: Use ``no_log: True``
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-42333`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks that target a subset of VMs (or
    servers/blades) part of a VNF (or PNF) instance **MUST** be designed to use
    the VNF or PNF inventory host file and to use a parameter named
    ``target_vm_list`` to provide the subset of VMs in the VNF instance
    specifically targeted by the playbook.

    NOTE: Example of such playbooks would be playbooks used to configure VMs
    added to a VNF instance as part of a scale-out/up or scale-in/down
    operation. Such playbook is expected to also need to perform
    configuration/reconfiguration tasks part of the base VNF instance build.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-43353`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **MUST** return control only
    after all tasks performed by playbook are fully complete, signaling that the
    playbook completed all tasks. When starting services, return control
    only after all services are up. This is critical for workflows where
    the next steps are dependent on prior tasks being fully completed.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-88786`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **SHOULD** place the passwords
    and secrets to be edited at the top of the single YAML or JSON file with
    all the secrets, and the (default) ones that are to remain unchanged '
    towards the bottom, with commentary separating them.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-33280`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **MUST NOT** contain instance
    specific values that can not be provided by a parameter to the playbook.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-56988`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **MUST** load any configuration
    data that requires encryption (passwords, secrets, etc.) in a JSON (.json),
    YAML (.yaml|.yml) or INI (.ini) file, from the
    ``<VNF type>/<Version>/ansible/vars`` directory.
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-02651`

    The VNF or PNF Provider's Ansible playbooks **SHOULD** use available backup
    capabilities to save a copy of configuration files before implementing
    changes to support operations such as backing out of software upgrades,
    configuration changes or other work as this will help backing out of
    configuration changes when needed.
    

Requirements Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

.. container:: note

    R-40293

    The VNF or PNF **MUST** make available playbooks that conform
    to the ONAP requirement.
    

.. container:: note

    R-49751

    The VNF or PNF **MUST** support Ansible playbooks that are compatible with
    Ansible version 2.6 or later.
    

Monitoring & Management > Bulk Performance Measurement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Requirements Changed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

.. container:: note

    :need:`R-75943`

    The VNF or PNF **SHOULD** support the data schema defined in 3GPP TS 32.435 or 3GPP TS 28.532, when
    supporting the event-driven bulk transfer of monitoring data.
    

Monitoring & Management > Monitoring & Management Requirements > Addressing and Delivery Protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Requirements Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

.. container:: note

    R-01033

    The VNF or PNF **MAY** use another option which is expected to include SFTP
    for asynchronous bulk files, such as bulk files that contain large volumes
    of data collected over a long time interval or data collected across many
    VNFs or PNFs. (Preferred is to reorganize the data into more frequent or more focused
    data sets, and deliver these by REST or TCP as appropriate.)
    

.. container:: note

    R-03070

    The VNF or PNF **MUST**, by ONAP Policy, provide the ONAP addresses
    as data destinations for each VNF or PNF, and may be changed by Policy while
    the VNF or PNF is in operation. We expect the VNF or PNF to be capable of redirecting
    traffic to changed destinations with no loss of data, for example from
    one REST URL to another, or from one TCP host and port to another.
    

.. container:: note

    R-08312

    The VNF or PNF **MAY** use another option which is expected to include REST
    delivery of binary encoded data sets.
    

.. container:: note

    R-63229

    The VNF or PNF **MAY** use another option which is expected to include REST
    for synchronous data, using RESTCONF (e.g., for VNF or PNF state polling).
    

.. container:: note

    R-79412

    The VNF or PNF **MAY** use another option which is expected to include TCP
    for high volume streaming asynchronous data sets and for other high volume
    data sets. TCP delivery can be used for either JSON or binary encoded data
    sets.
    

.. container:: note

    R-81777

    The VNF or PNF **MUST** be configured with initial address(es) to use
    at deployment time. Subsequently, address(es) may be changed through
    ONAP-defined policies delivered from ONAP to the VNF or PNF using PUTs to a
    RESTful API, in the same manner that other controls over data reporting
    will be controlled by policy.
    

.. container:: note

    R-84879

    The VNF or PNF **MUST** have the capability of maintaining a primary
    and backup DNS name (URL) for connecting to ONAP collectors, with the
    ability to switch between addresses based on conditions defined by policy
    such as time-outs, and buffering to store messages until they can be
    delivered. At its discretion, the service provider may choose to populate
    only one collector address for a VNF or PNF. In this case, the network will
    promptly resolve connectivity problems caused by a collector or network
    failure transparently to the VNF or PNF.
    

.. container:: note

    R-88482

    The VNF or PNF **SHOULD** use REST using HTTPS delivery of plain
    text JSON for moderate sized asynchronous data sets, and for high
    volume data sets when feasible.
    

Monitoring & Management > Monitoring & Management Requirements > Asynchronous and Synchronous Data Delivery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Requirements Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

.. container:: note

    R-11240

    The VNF or PNF **MUST** respond with content encoded in JSON, as
    described in the RESTCONF specification. This way the encoding of a
    synchronous communication will be consistent with Avro.
    

.. container:: note

    R-34660

    The VNF or PNF **MUST** use the RESTCONF/NETCONF framework used by
    the ONAP configuration subsystem for synchronous communication.
    

.. container:: note

    R-42140

    The VNF or PNF **MUST** respond to data requests from ONAP as soon
    as those requests are received, as a synchronous response.
    

.. container:: note

    R-43327

    The VNF or PNF **SHOULD** use `Modeling JSON text with YANG
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7951>`_, If YANG models need to be
    translated to and from JSON{RFC7951]. YANG configuration and content can
    be represented via JSON, consistent with Avro, as described in "Encoding
    and Serialization" section.
    

.. container:: note

    R-46290

    The VNF or PNF **MUST** respond to an ONAP request to deliver granular
    data on device or subsystem status or performance, referencing the YANG
    configuration model for the VNF or PNF by returning the requested data elements.
    

.. container:: note

    R-70266

    The VNF or PNF **MUST** respond to an ONAP request to deliver the
    current data for any of the record types defined in
    `Event Records - Data Structure Description`_ by returning the requested
    record, populated with the current field values. (Currently the defined
    record types include fault fields, mobile flow fields, measurements for
    VNF or PNF scaling fields, and syslog fields. Other record types will be added
    in the future as they become standardized and are made available.)
    

.. container:: note

    R-73285

    The VNF or PNF **MUST** must encode, address and deliver the data
    as described in the previous paragraphs.
    

.. container:: note

    R-86586

    The VNF or PNF **MUST** use the YANG configuration models and RESTCONF
    [RFC8040] (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8040).
    

Monitoring & Management > Monitoring & Management Requirements > Google Protocol Buffers (GPB)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Requirements Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

.. container:: note

    R-257367

    The VNF or PNF, when leveraging Google Protocol Buffers for events, **MUST**
    serialize the events using native Google Protocol Buffers (GPB) according
    to the following guidelines:

       * The keys are represented as integers pointing to the system resources
         for the VNF or PNF being monitored
       * The values correspond to integers or strings that identify the
         operational state of the VNF resource, such a statistics counters and
         the state of an VNF or PNF resource.
       * The required Google Protocol Buffers (GPB) metadata is provided in the
         form of .proto files.
    

.. container:: note

    R-978752

    The VNF or PNF providers **MUST** provide the Service Provider the following
    artifacts to support the delivery of high-volume VNF or PNF telemetry to
    DCAE via GPB over TLS/TCP:

       * A valid VES Event .proto definition file, to be used validate and
         decode an event
       * A valid high volume measurement .proto definition file, to be used for
         processing high volume events
       * A supporting PM content metadata file to be used by analytics
         applications to process high volume measurement events
    

Monitoring & Management > Monitoring & Management Requirements > JSON
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Requirements Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

.. container:: note

    R-19624

    The VNF or PNF, when leveraging JSON for events, **MUST** encode and serialize
    content delivered to ONAP using JSON (RFC 7159) plain text format.
    High-volume data is to be encoded and serialized using
    `Avro <http://avro.apache.org/>`_, where the Avro data
    format are described using JSON.
    

Monitoring & Management > Monitoring & Management Requirements > Reporting Frequency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Requirements Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

.. container:: note

    R-146931

    The VNF or PNF **MUST** report exactly one Measurement event per period
    per source name.
    

.. container:: note

    R-98191

    The VNF or PNF **MUST** vary the frequency that asynchronous data
    is delivered based on the content and how data may be aggregated or
    grouped together.

        Note:

        - For example, alarms and alerts are expected to be delivered as
          soon as they appear. In contrast, other content, such as performance
          measurements, KPIs or reported network signaling may have various
          ways of packaging and delivering content. Some content should be
          streamed immediately; or content may be monitored over a time
          interval, then packaged as collection of records and delivered
          as block; or data may be collected until a package of a certain
          size has been collected; or content may be summarized statistically
          over a time interval, or computed as a KPI, with the summary or KPI
          being delivered.
        - We expect the reporting frequency to be configurable depending on
          the virtual network functions needs for management. For example,
          Service Provider may choose to vary the frequency of collection
          between normal and trouble-shooting scenarios.
        - Decisions about the frequency of data reporting will affect
          the size of delivered data sets, recommended delivery method,
          and how the data will be interpreted by ONAP. These considerations
          should not affect deserialization and decoding of the data, which
          will be guided by the accompanying JSON schema or GPB definition
          files.
    

Monitoring & Management > Monitoring & Management Requirements > Security
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Requirements Removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    

.. container:: note

    R-01427

    If the VNF or PNF is using Basic Authentication, then the VNF or
    PNF **MUST** support the provisioning of security and authentication
    parameters (HTTP username and password) in order to be able to
    authenticate with DCAE VES Event Listener.

    Note: The configuration management and provisioning software
    are specific to a vendor architecture.
    

.. container:: note

    R-42366

    The VNF or PNF **MUST** support secure connections and transports such as
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol
    [`RFC5246 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246>`_] and should adhere to
    the best current practices outlined in
    `RFC7525 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7525>`_.
    

.. container:: note

    R-43387

    If the VNF or PNF is using Certificate Authentication, the
    VNF or PNF **MUST** support mutual TLS authentication and the Subject
    Name in the end-entity certificate MUST be used according to
    `RFC5280 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280>`_.

    Note: In mutual TLS authentication, the client (VNF or PNF) must
    authenticate the server (DCAE) certificate and must provide its own
    X.509v3 end-entity certificate to the server for authentication.
    

.. container:: note

    R-44290

    The VNF or PNF **MUST** control access to ONAP and to VNFs or PNFs, and creation
    of connections, through secure credentials, log-on and exchange mechanisms.
    

.. container:: note

    R-47597

    The VNF or PNF **MUST** carry data in motion only over secure connections.
    

.. container:: note

    R-55634

    If VNF or PNF is using Basic Authentication, then the VNF or PNF
    **MUST** be in compliance with
    `RFC7617 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617>`_ for authenticating HTTPS
