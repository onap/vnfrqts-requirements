Scope
=====

- The audience for this document are VNF or PNF providers, NCSPs and other
  interested 3rd parties who need to know the design, build and lifecycle
  management requirements for VNFs or PNFs to be compliant with ONAP.
- These requirements are strictly from a standpoint of what the VNF or PNF
  developer needs to know to operate and be compliant with ONAP.
- Requirements that are not applicable to VNF or PNF providers such as those
  that applicable to service providers are not included in this document.
- These requirements are applicable to the current release of ONAP.
- Scope of the ONAP versions/release and future functionality
- The VNF Requirements should include support for the functionality of the
  ONAP E-E use cases.
- These requirements apply to VNFs or PNFs at both ONAP Design-Time and ONAP
  Run-Time.
- Network Service Descriptions are beyond the scope of these requirements.
