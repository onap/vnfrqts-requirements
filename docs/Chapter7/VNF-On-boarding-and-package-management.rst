VNF On-boarding and package management
--------------------------------------

Design Definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ONAP Design Time Framework provides the ability to design NFV
resources including VNFs, Services, and products. The VNF provider must
provide VNF packages that include a rich set of recipes, management and
functional interfaces, policies, configuration parameters, and
infrastructure requirements that can be utilized by the ONAP Design
module to onboard and catalog these resources. Initially this
information may be provided in documents, but in the near future a
method will be developed to automate as much of the transfer of data as
possible to satisfy its long term requirements.

The current VNF Package Requirement is based on a subset of the
Requirements contained in the ETSI Document: ETSI GS NFV-MAN 001 v1.1.1
and GS NFV IFA011 V0.3.0 (2015-10) - Network Functions Virtualization
(NFV), Management and Orchestration, VNF Packaging Specification.
