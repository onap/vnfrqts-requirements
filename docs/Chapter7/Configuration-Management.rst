Configuration Management
------------------------

Controller Interactions With xNF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

APPC/SDN-C expose a northbound API to clients (such as SO) in order for
the clients to initiate an activity (aka command) on a xNF. APPC/SDN-C
interact with xNFs through Network and Application Adapters to perform
configuration and other lifecycle management activities within NFV environment.
The standardized models, protocols and mechanisms by which network functions
are configured are equally applicable to VNFs and PNFs.

This section describes the list of commands that should be supported
by the xNF. The following sections describe the standard protocols
that are supported (NETCONF, Chef, Ansible, and REST).

The commands below are expected to be supported on all xNF's, unless
The commands below are expected to be supported on all xNF's, unless
noted otherwise, either directly (via the NETCONF or REST interface)
or indirectly (via a Chef Cookbook or Ansible server).

**Note that there are additional commands offered to northbound clients that
are not shown below, as these commands either act internally on APPC/SDN-C
itself or depend upon network cloud components for implementation (thus, these
actions do not put any special requirement on the xNF provider).**

The commands allow for parametric data to be passed from APPC/SDN-C
to the xNF or Ansible/Chef server in the request. The format of the
parameter data can be either xml (for NETCONF) or JSON (for Ansible,
Chef, or REST).

Configuration Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Configure``: The APPC/SDN-C client is requesting that a post-instantiation
configuration be applied to the target xNF. After the Configure
action is completed, the xNF instance should be ready for service.
Note that customer specific configurations may need to be applied using
the ConfigModify action. This command requires exclusive access rights of
the xNF.

``ConfigModify``: The APPC client is requesting a configuration
update to a subset of the total configuration parameters of an xNF or to
apply customer specific configurations. The configuration update is
typically done while the xNF is in service and should not disrupt traffic.
This command requires exclusive access rights of the xNF.

``ConfigBackup``: The APPC client is requesting a backup of the
configuration parameters where the parameters are stored on the xNF.
This command is typically requested as part of an orchestration flow
for scenarios such as a software upgrade. The ConfigBackup is typically
done while the xNF is not in service (i.e., in a maintenance state).
When the ConfigBackup command is executed, the current xNF configuration
parameters are saved in storage that is preserved (if there is an existing
set of backed up parameters, they are overwritten). This command requires
exclusive access rights of the xNF.

``ConfigRestore``: The APPC client is requesting a restore action of
the configuration parameters to the xNF that were saved by ConfigBackup
command. This command is typically requested as part of an orchestration
flow for scenarios such as a software upgrade where the software upgrade
may have failed and the xNF needs to be rolled back to the prior configuration.
When the ConfigRestore command is executed, the xNF configuration parameters
which were backed to persistent preserved storage are applied to the xNF
(replacing existing parameters). The ConfigRestore is typically done while
the xNF is not in service (i.e., in a maintenance state). This command
requires exclusive access rights of the xNF.

``ConfigScaleOut``: The APPC/SDN-C client is requesting that a configuration
be applied after the VNF instance has been scaled out (i.e., one or more
additional VM's instantiated to increase capacity). For some VNF's,
ConfigScaleOut is not needed because the VNF is auto-configured after
scale-out. This command is being introduced in the Beijing release to support
manual Scale Out and will be extended to support Auto ScaleOut in Casablanca
release. This command requires exclusive access rights of the VNF.

``Audit``: The APPC client is requesting that the current (last known
configuration update) is audited against the running configuration on the VNF
(Openstack).

Lifecycle Management Related Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**The following commands are needed to support various lifecycle management
flows where the VNF may need to be removed for service.**

Full details on the APIs can be found in the :doc:`APPC LCM API Guide <../../../../appc.git/docs/APPC LCM API Guide/APPC LCM API Guide>`

``DistributeTraffic`` The APPC/SDN-C client is requesting a change to
traffic distribution (redistribution) done by a traffic balancing/distribution
entity (aka anchor point) or mechanism. This action targets the traffic
balancing/distribution entity, in some cases DNS, other cases a load balancer
external to the VNF instance, as examples. Traffic distribution (weight)
changes intended to take a VNF instance out of service are completed only
when all in-flight traffic/transactions have been completed. To complete
the traffic redistribution process, gracefully taking a VNF instance
out-of-service, without dropping in-flight calls or sessions, QuiesceTraffic
command may need to follow traffic distribution changes (assigning weight 0
or very low weight to VNF instance). The VNF application remains in an active
state.

``QuiesceTraffic`` The APPC/SDN-C client is requesting the xNF gracefully
stop traffic (aka block and drain traffic). The method for quiescing traffic
is specific to the xNF architecture. The action is completed when all
(in-flight transactions) traffic has stopped. The xNF remains in an active
state where the xNF is able to process traffic (initiated using the
ResumeTraffic action).

``ResumeTraffic``: The APPC/SDN-C client is requesting the xNF resume
processing traffic. The method to resume traffic is specific to the xNF
architecture.

``StopApplication``: The APPC client is requesting that the application
running on the xNF is stopped gracefully (i.e., without traffic loss).
This is equivalent to quiescing the traffic and then stopping the application
processes. The processes can be restarted using the StartApplication command.

``StartApplication``: The APPC client is requesting that the application
running on the xNF is started. Get ready to process traffic. Traffic processing
can be resumed using the ResumeTraffic command.

**The following commands are needed to support software upgrades, in-place or
other type of software upgrade. The xNF instance may be removed from service
for the upgrade.**

``UpgradePrecheck``: The APPC/SDN-C client is requesting a confirmation that
the xNF can (and needs to) be upgraded to a specific software version
(specified in the request). Checking software installed and running on
the xNF matches software version, intended to be upgraded, is one of the
recommended checks.

``UpgradeSoftware``: The APPC/SDN-C client is requesting that a (in-place)
software upgrade be performed on the xNF.  The software to be applied is
pre-loaded to a specified location.

``UpgradePostCheck``: The APPC/SDN-C client is requesting a confirmation that
the xNF software upgrade has been completed successfully (xNF upgraded to
the new software version). Checking software installed and running on the xNF
matches software version, of the newly upgraded software, is one of the
recommended checks.

``UpgradeBackup``: The APPC/SDN-C client is requesting that the xNF is backed
up prior to the UpgradeSoftware.

``UpgradeBackOut``: The APPC/SDN-C client is requesting that the xNF upgrade
is backed out (in the event that the SoftwareUpgrade or UpgradePostCheck
failed).

HealthCheck and Failure Related Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``HealthCheck`` The APPC/SDN-C client is requesting a health check over the
entire scope of the xNF. The xNF must be 100% healthy, ready to take requests
and provide services, with all xNF required capabilities ready to provide
services and with all active and standby resources fully ready with no open
MINOR, MAJOR or CRITICAL alarms. This is expected to be the default in the
event that no parameter is passed to the Healthcheck playbook, cookbook, etc.

Some xNFs may support and desire to run partial healthchecks and receive a
successful response when partial health check completes without errors.
The parameter name used by HealthCheck playbook to request non-default
partial health check is healthcheck_type. Example of health check types
could be healthcheck_type=GuestOS, healthcheck_type=noDB,
healthcheck_type=noConnections, healthcheck_type=IgnoreAlarms, etc..
This attribute-value pair may be passed by the Orchestrator or Workflow
or other (northbound) APPC/SDN-C clients to the APPC/SDN-C as part of the
request.

**Note**: In addition to the commands above, the APPC/SDN-C supports a set of
Openstack failure recovery related commands that are executed on-demand or via
Control Loop at the VM level. The VNF must support these commands in a fully
automated fashion.

.. req::
    :id: R-41430
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST
    :updated: casablanca

    The xNF **MUST** support APPC/SDN-C ``HealthCheck`` command.

Notes On Command Support Using APPC/SDN-C Southbound Protocols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

APPC/SDN-C are designed to support a standard set of protocols in
order to communicate with the xNF instance. The supported protocols are
NETCONF, Ansible, Chef, and REST.

NETCONF and REST require the xNF to implement a server which supports the RPC
or REST calls.

Ansible and Chef require the use of a Ansible or Chef server which communicates
with the APPC/SDN-C (northbound) and the xNF VM's (southbound).

The vendor must select which protocol to support for the commands listed above.
Notes:

* NETCONF is most suitable for configuration related commands.

* Ansible and Chef are suitable for any command.
  Ansible has the advantage that it is agentless.

* REST is specified as an option only for the HealthCheck.

NETCONF Standards and Capabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

APPC/SDN-C and their Adapters utilize device YANG model and
NETCONF APIs to make the required changes in the xNF state and
configuration. The xNF providers must provide the Device YANG model and
NETCONF server supporting NETCONF APIs to comply with target ONAP and
industry standards.

.. _xnf_rest_apis:

xNF REST APIs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HealthCheck is a command for which no NETCONF support exists.
Therefore, this must be supported using a RESTful interface
(defined in this section) or with a Chef cookbook/Ansible playbook
(defined in sections `Chef Standards and Capabilities`_ and
`Ansible Standards and Capabilities`_).

See section 7.3.1.4 for the definition of Full Healthcheck and Partial
Healthchecks.

The xNF must provide a REST formatted GET RPCs to support HealthCheck
queries via the GET method over HTTP(s).

The port number, url, and other authentication information is provided
by the xNF provider.

REST APIs
~~~~~~~~~

.. req::
    :id: R-31809
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** support the HealthCheck RPC. The HealthCheck
    RPC executes a xNF Provider-defined xNF HealthCheck over the scope of
    the entire xNF (e.g., if there are multiple VNFCs, then run a health check,
    as appropriate, for all VNFCs). It returns a 200 OK if the test completes.
    A JSON object is returned indicating state (healthy, unhealthy), scope
    identifier, time-stamp and one or more blocks containing info and fault
    information. If the xNF is unable to run the HealthCheck, return a
    standard http error code and message.

Examples of responses when HealthCheck runs and is able to provide a healthy
or unhealthy response:

.. code-block:: java

 {
   "identifier": "scope represented",
   "state": "healthy",
   "time": "01-01-1000:0000"
 }

 {
   "identifier": "scope represented",
   "state": "unhealthy",
    {[
   "info": "System threshold exceeded details",
   "fault":
     {
       "cpuOverall": 0.80,
       "cpuThreshold": 0.45
     }
     ]},
   "time": "01-01-1000:0000"
 }


Chef Standards and Capabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ONAP will support configuration of xNFs via Chef subject to the
requirements and guidelines defined in this section.

The Chef configuration management mechanism follows a client-server
model. It requires the presence of a Chef-Client on the xNF that will be
directly managed by a Chef Server. The Chef-client will register with
the appropriate Chef Server and are managed via 'cookbooks' and
configuration attributes loaded on the Chef Server which contain all
necessary information to execute the appropriate actions on the xNF via
the Chef-client.

ONAP will utilize the open source Chef Server, invoke the documented
Chef REST APIs to manage the xNF and requires the use of open source
Chef-Client and Push Jobs Client on the xNF
(https://downloads.chef.io/).

    (roles/cookbooks/recipes) required to execute xNF actions requested by
    ONAP for loading on appropriate Chef Server.

.. req::
    :id: R-26567
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST
    :updated: casablanca

    The xNF Package **MUST** include a run list of
    roles/cookbooks/recipes, for each supported xNF action, that will
    perform the desired xNF action in its entirety as specified by ONAP
    (see Section 7.c, APPC/SDN-C APIs and Behavior, for list of xNF
    actions and requirements), when triggered by a chef-client run list
    in JSON file.

.. req::
    :id: R-98911
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST NOT

    The xNF **MUST NOT** use any instance specific parameters
    for the xNF in roles/cookbooks/recipes invoked for a xNF action.

.. req::
    :id: R-37929
    :target: XNF

.. req::
    :id: R-62170
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** over-ride any default values for
    configurable parameters that can be set by ONAP in the roles,
    cookbooks and recipes.

.. req::
    :id: R-78116
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** update status on the Chef Server
    appropriately (e.g., via a fail or raise an exception) if the
    chef-client run encounters any critical errors/failures when
    executing a xNF action.

.. req::
    :id: R-44013
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** populate an attribute, defined as node
    ['PushJobOutput'] with the desired output on all nodes in the push job
    that execute chef-client run if the xNF action requires the output of a
    chef-client run be made available (e.g., get running configuration).

.. req::
    :id: R-30654
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF Package **MUST** have appropriate cookbooks that are
    designed to automatically 'rollback' to the original state in case of
    any errors for actions that change state of the xNF (e.g., configure).

.. req::
    :id: R-65755
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: SHOULD

    The xNF **SHOULD** support callback URLs to return information
    to ONAP upon completion of the chef-client run for any chef-client run
    associated with a xNF action.

    -  As part of the push job, ONAP will provide two parameters in the
       environment of the push job JSON object:

        -  "RequestId" a unique Id to be used to identify the request,
        -  "CallbackUrl", the URL to post response back.

    -  If the CallbackUrl field is empty or missing in the push job, then
       the chef-client run need not post the results back via callback.

.. req::
    :id: R-15885
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** Upon completion of the chef-client run,
    POST back on the callback URL, a JSON object as described in Table
    A2 if the chef-client run list includes a cookbook/recipe that is
    callback capable. Failure to POST on the Callback Url should not be
    considered a critical error. That is, if the chef-client successfully
    completes the xNF action, it should reflect this status on the Chef
    Server regardless of whether the Callback succeeded or not.

ONAP Chef API Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section outlines the workflow that ONAP invokes when it receives an
action request against a Chef managed xNF.

1. When ONAP receives a request for an action for a Chef Managed xNF, it
   retrieves the corresponding template (based on **action** and
   **xNF**) from its database and sets necessary values in the
   "Environment", "Node" and "NodeList" keys (if present) from either
   the payload of the received action or internal data.

2. If "Environment" key is present in the updated template, it posts the
   corresponding JSON dictionary to the appropriate Environment object
   REST endpoint on the Chef Server thus updating the Environment
   attributes on the Chef Server.

3. Next, it creates a Node Object from the "Node" JSON dictionary for
   all elements listed in the NodeList (using the FQDN to construct the
   endpoint) by replicating it  [#7.3.2]_. As part of this process, it will
   set the name field in each Node Object to the corresponding FQDN.
   These node objects are then posted on the Chef Server to
   corresponding Node Object REST endpoints to update the corresponding
   node attributes.

4. If PushJobFlag is set to "True" in the template, ONAP requests a push
   job against all the nodes in the NodeList to trigger
   chef-client. It will not invoke any other command via the push
   job. ONAP will include a callback URL in the push job request and a
   unique Request Id. An example push job posted by ONAP is listed
   below:

.. code-block:: java

  {
   "command": "chef-client"
   "run_timeout": 300
   "nodes": ["node1.vnf_a.onap.com", "node2.vnf_a.onap.com"]
     "env": {
              "RequestId":"8279-abcd-aksdj-19231"
              "CallbackUrl":"<callback>"
            }
  }


5. If CallbackCapable field in the template is not present or set to
   "False" ONAP will poll the Chef Server to check completion status of
   the push job.

6. If "GetOutputFlag" is set to "True" in the template and
   CallbackCapable is not set to "True", ONAP will retrieve any output
   from each node where the push job has finished by accessing the Node
   Object attribute node['PushJobOutput'].

.. _ansible_playbook_requirements:

Ansible Standards and Capabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ONAP will support configuration of xNFs via Ansible subject to the
requirements and guidelines defined in this section.

Ansible allows agentless management of xNFs/VMs/VNFCs via execution
of 'playbooks' over ssh. The 'playbooks' are a structured set of
tasks which contain all the necessary resources and execution capabilities
to take the necessary action on one or more target VMs (and/or VNFCs)
of the VNF. ONAP will utilize the framework of an Ansible Server that
will host all Ansible artifacts and run playbooks to manage xNFs that support
Ansible.

    Cloud Service Provider guidelines for authentication and access.

.. req::
    :id: R-82018
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST
    :updated: casablanca

    The xNF **MUST** load the Ansible Server SSH public key onto xNF
    VM(s) /root/.ssh/authorized_keys as part of instantiation. Alternative,
    is for Ansible Server SSH public key to be loaded onto xNF VM(s) under
    /home/<Mechanized user ID>/.ssh/authorized_keys as part of instantiation,
    when a Mechanized user ID is created during instantiation, and Configure
    and all playbooks are designed to use a mechanized user ID only for
    authentication (never using root authentication during Configure playbook
    run). This will allow the Ansible Server to authenticate to perform
    post-instantiation configuration without manual intervention and without
    requiring specific xNF login IDs and passwords.

    *CAUTION*: For xNFs configured using Ansible, to eliminate the need
    for manual steps, post-instantiation and pre-configuration, to
    upload of SSH public keys, SSH public keys loaded during (heat)
    instantiation shall be preserved and not removed by (heat) embedded
    (userdata) scripts.

Ansible Playbook Requirements
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An Ansible playbook is a collection of tasks that is executed on the
Ansible server (local host) and/or the target VM (s) in order to
complete the desired action.

.. req::
    :id: R-49751
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST
    :introduced: casablanca

    The xNF **MUST** support Ansible playbooks that are compatible with
    Ansible version 2.6 or later. 

.. req::
    :id: R-40293
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** make available playbooks that conform
    to the ONAP requirement.

.. req::
    :id: R-49396
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST
    :updated: casablanca

    The xNF **MUST** support each APPC/SDN-C xNF action
    by invocation of **one** playbook [#7.3.4]_. The playbook will be responsible
    for executing all necessary tasks (as well as calling other playbooks)
    to complete the request.

.. req::
    :id: R-33280
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST NOT

    The xNF **MUST NOT** use any instance specific parameters
    in a playbook.

.. req::
    :id: R-48698
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST
    :updated: casablanca

    The xNF **MUST** utilize information from key value pairs that will be
    provided by the Ansible Server as "extra-vars" during invocation to
    execute the desired xNF action. The "extra-vars" attribute-value pairs
    are passed to the Ansible Server by an APPC/SDN-C as part of the
    Rest API request. If the playbook requires files, they must also be
    supplied using the methodology detailed in the Ansible Server API, unless
    they are bundled with playbooks, example, generic templates. Any files
    containing instance specific info (attribute-value pairs), not obtainable
    from any ONAP inventory databases or other sources, referenced and used an
    input by playbooks, shall be provisioned (and distributed) in advance of
    use, e.g., xNF instantiation. Recommendation is to avoid these instance
    specific, manually created in advance of instantiation, files.

The Ansible Server will determine if a playbook invoked to execute an
xNF action finished successfully or not using the "PLAY_RECAP" summary
in Ansible log.  The playbook will be considered to successfully finish
only if the "PLAY RECAP" section at the end of playbook execution output
has no unreachable hosts and no failed tasks. Otherwise, the playbook
will be considered to have failed.


.. req::
    :id: R-43253
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** use playbooks designed to allow Ansible
    Server to infer failure or success based on the "PLAY_RECAP" capability.

    **Note**: There are cases where playbooks need to interpret results
    of a task and then determine success or failure and return result
    accordingly (failure for failed tasks).

.. req::
    :id: R-50252
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST
    :updated: casablanca

    The xNF **MUST** write to a response file in JSON format that will be
    retrieved and made available by the Ansible Server if, as part of a xNF
    action (e.g., audit), a playbook is required to return any xNF
    information/response. The text files must be written in the main playbook
    home directory, in JSON format. The JSON file must be created for the xNF
    with the name '<xNF name>_results.txt'. All playbook output results, for
    all xNF VMs, to be provided as a response to the request, must be written
    to this response file. 

.. req::
    :id: R-51442
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: SHOULD
    :updated: casablanca

    The xNF **SHOULD** use playbooks that are designed to
    automatically 'rollback' to the original state in case of any errors
    for actions that change state of the xNF (e.g., configure).

    **Note**: In case rollback at the playbook level is not supported or
    possible, the xNF provider shall provide alternative rollback
    mechanism (e.g., for a small xNF the rollback mechanism may rely
    on workflow to terminate and re-instantiate VNF VMs and then re-run
    playbook(s)). Backing up updated files is also recommended to support
    rollback when soft rollback is feasible.

    Cloud resources e.g. Openstack (nova, neutron, glance, heat, etc.);
    therefore, there is no use for Cloud specific variables like Openstack
    UUIDs in Ansible Playbook related artifacts.

    **Rationale**: Flows that require interactions with Cloud services e.g.
    Openstack shall rely on workflows run by an Orchestrator
    (Change Management) or other capability (such as a control loop or
    Operations GUI) outside Ansible Server which can be executed by a
    APPC/SDN-C. There are policies, as part of Control Loop
    models, that send remediation action requests to an APPC/SDN-C; these
    are triggered as a response to an event or correlated events published
    to Event Bus.

    The xNF **SHOULD** use available backup capabilities to save a
    copy of configuration files before implementing changes to support
    operations such as backing out of software upgrades, configuration
    changes or other work as this will help backing out of configuration
    changes when needed.

    The xNF **MUST** return control from Ansible Playbooks only after all
    tasks performed by playbook are fully complete, signaling that the
    playbook completed all tasks. When starting services, return control
    only after all services are up. This is critical for workflows where
    the next steps are dependent on prior tasks being fully completed.

Detailed examples:

``StopApplication Playbook`` â StopApplication Playbook shall return control
and a completion status response only after xNF application is fully stopped,
all processes/services stopped.

``StartApplication Playbook`` â StartApplication Playbook shall return control
and a completion status only after all xNF application services are fully up,
all processes/services started and ready to provide services.

**NOTE**: Start Playbook should not be declared complete/done after starting
one or several processes that start the other processes.

HealthCheck Playbook:

SUCCESS â HealthCheck success shall be returned (return code 0) by a
Playbook or Cookbook only when xNF is 100% healthy, ready to take requests
and provide services, with all xNF required capabilities ready to provide
services and with all active and standby resources fully ready with no
open MINOR, MAJOR or CRITICAL alarms.

NOTE: In some cases, a switch may need to be turned on, but a xNF
reported as healthy, should be ready to take service requests or be
already processing service requests successfully.

A successful execution of a health-check playbook shall create one response
file (per xNF) in JSON format, named after the xNF instance, followed by
"_results.txt" (<xNF instance name>_results.txt) to be provided as a response
to the requestor, indicating  health-check was executed and completed
successfully, example: vfdb9904v_results.txt, with the following contents:

.. code-block:: java

  {
   "identifier": "VNF",
   "state": "healthy",
   "time": "2018-03-16:1139"
  }

Example:

.. code-block:: java

  $ cat vfdb9904v_results.txt
  {
   "identifier": "VNF",
   "state": "healthy",
   "time": "2018-03-16:1139"
  }


**NOTE**: See section 7.3.1.4 for comments on support of partial health checks.

FAILURE â A health check playbook shall return a non-zero return code in
case xNF is not 100% healthy because one or more xNF application processes
are stopped or not ready to take service requests or because critical or
non-critical resources are not ready or because there are open MINOR, MAJOR
or CRITICAL traps/alarms or because there are issues with the xNF that
need attention even if they do not impact services provided by the xNF.

A failed health-check playbook shall also create one file (per xNF), in
JSON format, named after the xNF instance name, followed by "_results.txt"
to indicate health-check was executed and found issues in the health of
the xNF. This is to differentiate from failure to run health-check playbook
or playbook tasks to verify the health of the xNF,
example: vfdb9904v_results.txt, with the following contents:

.. code-block:: java

 {
  "identifier": "VNF",
  "state": "unhealthy",
  "info": "Error in following VM(s). Check hcstatus files
  under /tmp/ccfx9901v for details",
  "fault": [
    "vfdb9904vm001",
    "vfdb9904vm002"
  ],
  "time": "2018-03-16:4044"
 }


Example:

.. code-block:: java

 $ cat vfdb9904v_results.txt
 {
  "identifier": "VNF",
  "state": "unhealthy",
  "info": "Error in following VM(s). Check hcstatus files
  under /tmp/ccfx9901v for details",
  "fault": [
    "vfdb9904vm001",
    "vfdb9904vm002"
  ],
  "time": "2018-03-16:4044"
 }


See `xNF REST APIs`_ for additional details on HealthCheck.

Some xNFs may support and desire to run partial health checks and receive
a successful response when partial health check completes without errors.
The parameter name used by HealthCheck playbook to request non-default
partial health check is healthcheck_type. Example of health check types
could be healthcheck_type=GuestOS, healthcheck_type=noDB,
healthcheck_type=noConnections, healthcheck_type=IgnoreAlarms, etc.. This
attribute-value pair may be passed by Orchestrator or Workflow or other
(northbound) APPC/SDN-C clients to APPC/SDN-C as part of the request.

By default, when no argument/parameter is passed, healthcheck playbook
performs a full xNF health check.

    it is deployed to the production.


Ansible API Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section outlines the workflow that APPC/SDN-C invokes when
it receives an action request against an Ansible managed xNF.

 #. When APPC/SDN-C receives a request for an action for an
    Ansible managed xNF, it retrieves the corresponding template (based
    on **action** and **xNF Type**) from its database and sets necessary
    values (such as an Id, NodeList, and EnvParameters) from either
    information either in the request or data obtained from other sources,
    inventory database, is an example of such sources.
    This is referred to as the payload that is sent as a JSON object
    to the Ansible server as part of the Rest API request.
 #. The APPC/SDN-C sends a request to the Ansible server to
    execute the action.
 #. The APPC/SDN-C, after sending a request to the Ansible server,
    polls it to get results(success or failure). The APPC/SDN-C has a
    timeout value which is contained in the action request template. Different
    actions can set different timeout values (default setting is 600 seconds).
    If the result is not available when the timeout is reached, the APPC/SDN-C
    stops polling and returns a timeout error to the requester.
    The Ansible Server continues to process the request.
