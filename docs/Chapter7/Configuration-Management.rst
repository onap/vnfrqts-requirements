Configuration Management
------------------------

Controller Interactions With VNF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ONAP Controllers (such as APPC) expose a northbound API to clients
(such as SO) in order for the clients to initiate an activity
(aka command) on a VNF.   ONAP controllers interact with VNFs through
Network and Application Adapters to perform configuration and other
lifecycle management activities within NFV environment.
The standardized models, protocols and mechanisms by which network
functions are configured are equally applicable to VNFs and PNFs.

This section describes the list of commands that should be supported
by the VNF.   The following sections describe the standard protocols
that are supported (NETCONF, Chef, Ansible, and REST).

The commands below are expected to be supported on all VNF's, unless
noted otherwise, either directly (via the NETCONF or REST interface)
or indirectly (via a Chef Cookbook or Ansible server).  Note that there
are additional commands offered to northbound clients that are not shown
below, as these commands either act internally on the Controller itself
or depend upon network cloud components for implementation (thus, these
actions do not put any special requirement on the VNF provider).

The commands allow for parametric data to be passed from the controller
to the VNF or Ansible/Chef server in the request.  The format of the
parameter data can be either xml (for NETCONF) or JSON (for Ansible,
Chef, or REST).

Configuration Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Configure**: The Controller client is requesting that a post-instantiation
configuration be applied to the target VNF instance. After the Configure
action is completed, the VNF instance should be ready for service.
Note that customer specific configurations may need to be applied using
the ConfigModify action.

**ConfigModify**: The Controller client is requesting a configuration
update to a subset of the total configuration parameters of a VNF or to
apply customer specific configurations. The configuration update is
typically done while the VNF is in service and should not disrupt traffic.

**ConfigBackup**: The Controller client is requesting a backup of the
configuration parameters where the parameters are stored on the VNF.
This command is typically requested as part of an orchestration flow
for scenarios such as a software upgrade. The ConfigBackup is typically
done while the VNF is not in service (i.e., in a maintenance state).
When the ConfigBackup command is executed, the current VNF configuration
parameters are saved in storage that is preserved (if there is an existing
set of backed up parameters, they are overwritten).

**ConfigRestore**: The Controller client is requesting a restore action of
the configuration parameters to the VNF that were saved by ConfigBackup
command. This command is typically requested as part of an orchestration
flow for scenarios such as a software upgrade where the software upgrade
may have failed and the VNF needs to be rolled back to the prior configuration.
When the ConfigRestore command is executed, the VNF configuration parameters
which were backed to persistent preserved storage are applied to the VNF
(replacing existing parameters). The ConfigRestore is typically done while
the VNF is not in service (i.e., in a maintenance state).

**ConfigScaleOut**: The Controller client is requesting that a configuration
be applied after the VNF instance has been scaled out (i.e., one or more
additional VM's instantiated to increase capacity). For some VNF's,
ConfigScaleOut is not needed because the VNF is auto-configured after
scale-out. This command is being introduced in the Beijing release.

**Audit**: The Controller client is requesting that the current (last known
configuration update) is audited against the running configuration on the VNF.

LifeCycle Management Related Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**The following commands are needed to support various lifecycle management
flows where the VNF may need to be removed for service.**

**QuiesceTraffic**: The Controller client is requesting the VNF gracefully
stop traffic (aka block and drain traffic). The method for quiescing traffic
is specific to the VNF architecture. The action is completed when all
(in-flight transactions) traffic has stopped.   The VNF remains in an active
state where the VNF is able to process traffic (initiated using the
StartTraffic action).

**ResumeTraffic**: The Controller client is requesting the VNF resume
processing traffic. The method to resume traffic is specific to the VNF
architecture.

**StopApplication**: The Controller client is requesting that the application
running on the VNF is stopped gracefully (i.e., without traffic loss).
This is equivalent to quiescing the traffic and then stopping the application
processes. The processes can be restarted using the StartApplication command.

**StartApplication**: The Controller client is requesting that the application
running on the VNF is started. Get ready to process traffic.

**The following commands are needed to support software upgrades, in-place or
other type of software upgrade. The VNF instance may be removed from service
for the upgrade.**

**UpgradePrecheck**: The Controller client is requesting a confirmation that
the VNF can (and needs to) be upgraded to a specific software version
(specified in the request).

**UpgradeSoftware**: The Controller client is requesting that a (in-place)
software upgrade be performed on the VNF.  The software to be applied is
pre-loaded to a specified location.

**UpgradePostCheck**: The Controller client is requesting a confirmation that
the VNF software upgrade has been completed successfully (VNF upgraded to
the new software version).

**UpgradeBackup**: The Controller client is requesting that the VNF is backed
up prior to the UpgradeSoftware.

**UpgradeBackOut**: The Controller client is requesting that the VNF upgrade
is backed out (in the event that the SoftwareUpgrade or UpgradePostCheck
failed).

    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** support ONAP Controller's **UpgradeBackOut** command.

HealthCheck and Failure Related Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**HealthCheck**: The Controller client is requesting a health check over the
entire scope of the VNF.  The VNF must be 100% healthy, ready to take requests
and provide services, with all VNF required capabilities ready to provide
services and with all active and standby resources fully ready with no open
MINOR, MAJOR or CRITICAL alarms.

Note: In addition to the commands above, the Controller supports a set of
Openstack failure recovery related commands that are executed on-demand or via
Control Loop at the VM level.  The VNF must support these commands in a fully
automated fashion.


.. req::
    :id: R-41430
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** support ONAP Controller's **HealthCheck** command.

Notes On Command Support Using Controller Southbound Protocols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ONAP Controllers are designed to support a standard set of protocols in
order to communicate with the VNF instance.  The supported protocols are
NETCONF, Ansible, Chef, and REST.

NETCONF and REST require the VNF to implement a server which supports the RPC
or REST calls.

Ansible and Chef require the use of a Ansible or Chef server which communicates
with the Controller (northbound) and the VNF VM's (southbound).

The vendor must select which protocol to support for the commands listed above.
Notes:

* NETCONF is most suitable for configuration related commands

* Ansible and Chef are suitable for any command.
  Ansible has the advantage that it is agentless.

* REST is specified as an option only for the HealthCheck.

NETCONF Standards and Capabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ONAP Controllers and their Adapters utilize device YANG model and
NETCONF APIs to make the required changes in the VNF state and
configuration. The VNF providers must provide the Device YANG model and
NETCONF server supporting NETCONF APIs to comply with target ONAP and
industry standards.

.. _vnf_rest_apis:

VNF REST APIs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HealthCheck is a command for which no NETCONF support exists.
Therefore, this must be supported using a RESTful interface
(defined in this section) or with a Chef cookbook/Ansible playbook
(defined in sections `Chef Standards and Capabilities`_ and
`Ansible Standards and Capabilities`_).

HealthCheck Definition: The VNF level HealthCheck is a check over
the entire scope of the VNF. The VNF must be 100% healthy, ready
to take requests and provide services, with all VNF required
capabilities ready to provide services and with all active and
standby resources fully ready with no open MINOR, MAJOR or CRITICAL
alarms.  NOTE: A switch may need to be turned on, but the VNF should
be ready to take service requests or be already processing service
requests successfully.

The VNF must provide a REST formatted GET RPCs to support HealthCheck
queries via the GET method over HTTP(s).

The port number, url, and other authentication information is provided
by the VNF provider.

REST APIs
~~~~~~~~~


.. req::
    :id: R-31809
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** support the HealthCheck RPC. The HealthCheck
    RPC executes a xNF Provider-defined xNF HealthCheck over the scope of
    the entire xNF (e.g., if there are multiple VNFCs, then run a health check,
    as appropriate, for all VNFCs). It returns a 200 OK if the test completes.
    A JSON object is returned indicating state (healthy, unhealthy), scope
    identifier, time-stamp and one or more blocks containing info and fault
    information. If the xNF is unable to run the HealthCheck, return a
    standard http error code and message.

Examples of responses when HealthCheck runs and is able to provide a healthy
or unhealthy response:

.. code-block:: java

 {
   "identifier": "scope represented",
   "state": "healthy",
   "time": "01-01-1000:0000"
 }

 {

 }


Chef Standards and Capabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ONAP will support configuration of VNFs via Chef subject to the
requirements and guidelines defined in this section.

The Chef configuration management mechanism follows a client-server
model. It requires the presence of a Chef-Client on the VNF that will be
directly managed by a Chef Server. The Chef-client will register with
the appropriate Chef Server and are managed via 'cookbooks' and
configuration attributes loaded on the Chef Server which contain all
necessary information to execute the appropriate actions on the VNF via
the Chef-client.

ONAP will utilize the open source Chef Server, invoke the documented
Chef REST APIs to manage the VNF and requires the use of open source
Chef-Client and Push Jobs Client on the VNF
(https://downloads.chef.io/).

    actions and requirements), when triggered by a chef-client run list
    in JSON file.

.. req::
    :id: R-98911
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST NOT

    The xNF **MUST NOT** use any instance specific parameters

    cookbooks and recipes.

.. req::
    :id: R-78116
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** update status on the Chef Server
    appropriately (e.g., via a fail or raise an exception) if the
    chef-client run encounters any critical errors/failures when
    executing a xNF action.

.. req::
    :id: R-44013
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** populate an attribute, defined as node
    ['PushJobOutput'] with the desired output on all nodes in the push job
    that execute chef-client run if the xNF action requires the output of a
    chef-client run be made available (e.g., get running configuration).

.. req::
    :id: R-30654
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF Package **MUST** have appropriate cookbooks that are
    designed to automatically 'rollback' to the original state in case of
    any errors for actions that change state of the xNF (e.g., configure).

.. req::
    :id: R-65755
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: SHOULD

    The xNF **SHOULD** support callback URLs to return information
    to ONAP upon completion of the chef-client run for any chef-client run
    associated with a xNF action.

    -  As part of the push job, ONAP will provide two parameters in the
       environment of the push job JSON object:

        -  "RequestId" a unique Id to be used to identify the request,
        -  "CallbackUrl", the URL to post response back.

    -  If the CallbackUrl field is empty or missing in the push job, then
       the chef-client run need not post the results back via callback.

.. req::
    :id: R-15885
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** Upon completion of the chef-client run,
    POST back on the callback URL, a JSON object as described in Table
    A2 if the chef-client run list includes a cookbook/recipe that is
    callback capable. Failure to POST on the Callback Url should not be
    considered a critical error. That is, if the chef-client successfully
    completes the xNF action, it should reflect this status on the Chef
    Server regardless of whether the Callback succeeded or not.

ONAP Chef API Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section outlines the workflow that ONAP invokes when it receives an
action request against a Chef managed VNF.

1. When ONAP receives a request for an action for a Chef Managed VNF, it
   retrieves the corresponding template (based on **action** and
   **VNF)** from its database and sets necessary values in the
   "Environment", "Node" and "NodeList" keys (if present) from either
   the payload of the received action or internal data.

2. If "Environment" key is present in the updated template, it posts the
   corresponding JSON dictionary to the appropriate Environment object
   REST endpoint on the Chef Server thus updating the Environment
   attributes on the Chef Server.

3. Next, it creates a Node Object from the "Node" JSON dictionary for
   all elements listed in the NodeList (using the FQDN to construct the
   endpoint) by replicating it  [#7.3.2]_. As part of this process, it will
   set the name field in each Node Object to the corresponding FQDN.
   These node objects are then posted on the Chef Server to
   corresponding Node Object REST endpoints to update the corresponding
   node attributes.

4. If PushJobFlag is set to "True" in the template, ONAP requests a push
   job against all the nodes in the NodeList to trigger
   chef-client\ **.** It will not invoke any other command via the push
   job. ONAP will include a callback URL in the push job request and a
   unique Request Id. An example push job posted by ONAP is listed
   below:

.. code-block:: java

  {
   "command": "chef-client"
   "run\_timeout": 300
   "nodes": ["node1.vnf\_a.onap.com", "node2.vnf\_a.onap.com"]
     "env": {
              "RequestId":"8279-abcd-aksdj-19231"
              "CallbackUrl":"<callback>"
            }
  }


5. If CallbackCapable field in the template is not present or set to
   "False" ONAP will poll the Chef Server to check completion status of
   the push job.

6. If "GetOutputFlag" is set to "True" in the template and
   CallbackCapable is not set to "True", ONAP will retrieve any output
   from each node where the push job has finished by accessing the Node
   Object attribute node['PushJobOutput'].

Ansible Standards and Capabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ONAP will support configuration of VNFs via Ansible subject to the
requirements and guidelines defined in this section.

Ansible allows agentless management of VNFs/VMs/VNFCs via execution
of 'playbooks' over ssh. The 'playbooks' are a structured set of
tasks which contain all the necessary resources and execution capabilities
to take the necessary action on one or more target VMs (and/or VNFCs)
of the VNF. ONAP will utilize the framework of an Ansible Server that
will host all Ansible artifacts and run playbooks to manage VNFs that support
Ansible.

VNF Configuration via Ansible Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ansible Client Requirements
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


.. req::
    :id: R-32217
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** have routable FQDNs that are reachable via
    the Ansible Server for the endpoints (VMs) of a xNF on which playbooks
    will be executed. ONAP will initiate requests to the Ansible Server
    for invocation of playbooks against these end points [#7.3.3]_.

.. req::
    :id: R-54373
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** have Python >= 2.6 on the endpoint VM(s)
    of a xNF on which an Ansible playbook will be executed.

.. req::
    :id: R-35401
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** support SSH and allow SSH access by the
    Ansible server for the endpoint VM(s) and comply with the Network
    Cloud Service Provider guidelines for authentication and access.

.. req::
    :id: R-82018
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** load the Ansible Server SSH public key onto xNF
    VM(s) as part of instantiation. This will allow the Ansible Server
    to authenticate to perform post-instantiation configuration without
    manual intervention and without requiring specific xNF login IDs and
    passwords.

    CAUTION: For VNFs configured using Ansible, to eliminate the need
    for manual steps, post-instantiation and pre-configuration, to
    upload of SSH public keys, SSH public keys loaded during (heat)
    instantiation shall be preserved and not removed by (heat) embedded
    (userdata) scripts.

.. req::
    :id: R-92866
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** include as part of post-instantiation configuration
    done by Ansible Playbooks the removal/update of the SSH public key from
    /root/.ssh/authorized_keys, and  update of SSH keys loaded through
    instantiation to support Ansible. This may include download and install of
    new SSH keys and new mechanized IDs.

.. req::
    :id: R-91745
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** update the Ansible Server and other entities
    storing and using the SSH keys for authentication when the SSH
    keys used by Ansible are regenerated/updated.

    Note: Ansible Server itself may be used to upload new SSH public
    keys onto supported VNFs.

.. ansible_playbook_requirements:

Ansible Playbook Requirements
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An Ansible playbook is a collection of tasks that is executed on the
Ansible server (local host) and/or the target VM (s) in order to
complete the desired action.


.. req::
    :id: R-40293
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** make available playbooks that conform
    to the ONAP requirement.

.. req::
    :id: R-49396
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** support each ONAP (APPC) xNF action
    by invocation of **one** playbook [#7.3.4]_. The playbook will be responsible
    for executing all necessary tasks (as well as calling other playbooks)
    to complete the request.

.. req::
    :id: R-33280
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST NOT

    The xNF **MUST NOT** use any instance specific parameters
    in a playbook.

.. req::
    :id: R-48698
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** utilize information from key value pairs
    that will be provided by the Ansible Server as "extra-vars" during
    invocation to execute the desired xNF action. If the playbook requires
    files, they must also be supplied using the methodology detailed in
    the Ansible Server API, unless they are bundled with playbooks, example,
    generic templates.

The Ansible Server will determine if a playbook invoked to execute a
xNF action finished successfully or not using the "PLAY_RECAP" summary
in Ansible log.  The playbook will be considered to successfully finish
only if the "PLAY RECAP" section at the end of playbook execution output
has no unreachable hosts and no failed tasks. Otherwise, the playbook
will be considered to have failed.


.. req::
    :id: R-43253
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** use playbooks designed to allow Ansible
    Server to infer failure or success based on the "PLAY_RECAP" capability.

    Note: There are cases where playbooks need to interpret results
    of a task and then determine success or failure and return result
    accordingly (failure for failed tasks).

.. req::
    :id: R-50252
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** write to a specific one text files that
    will be retrieved and made available by the Ansible Server if, as part
    of a xNF action (e.g., audit), a playbook is required to return any
    xNF information. The text files must be written in the same directory as
    the one from which the playbook is being executed. A text file must be
    created for the xNF playbook run targets/affects, with the name
    '<VNFname>_results.txt' into which any desired output from each
    respective VM/xNF must be written.

.. req::
    :id: R-51442
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: SHOULD

    The xNF **SHOULD** use playbooks that are designed to
    automatically 'rollback' to the original state in case of any errors
    for actions that change state of the xNF (e.g., configure).

        Note: In case rollback at the playbook level is not supported or
        possible, the xNF provider shall provide alternative locking
        mechanism (e.g., for a small xNF the rollback mechanism may rely
        on workflow to terminate and re-instantiate VNF VMs and then re-run
        playbook(s)). Backing up updated files also recommended to support
        rollback when soft rollback is feasible.

.. req::
    :id: R-58301
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: SHOULD NOT

    The xNF **SHOULD NOT** use playbooks that make requests to
    Cloud resources e.g. Openstack (nova, neutron, glance, heat, etc.);
    therefore, there is no use for Cloud specific variables like Openstack
    UUIDs in Ansible Playbooks.

    Rationale: Flows that require interactions with Cloud services e.g.
    Openstack shall rely on workflows run by an Orchestrator
    (Change Management) or other capability (such as a control loop or
    Operations GUI) outside Ansible Server which can be executed by a
    Controller such as APPC. There are policies, as part of Control Loop
    models, that send remediation action requests to APPC; these are
    triggered as a response to an event or correlated events published
    to Event Bus.

.. req::
    :id: R-02651
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: SHOULD

    The xNF **SHOULD** use the Ansible backup feature to save a
    copy of configuration files before implementing changes to support
    operations such as backing out of software upgrades, configuration
    changes or other work as this will help backing out of configuration
    changes when needed.

.. req::
    :id: R-43353
    :target: XNF
    :keyword: MUST

    The xNF **MUST** return control from Ansible Playbooks only
    after tasks are fully complete, signaling that the playbook completed
    all tasks. When starting services, return control only after all services
    are up. This is critical for workflows where the next steps are dependent
    on prior tasks being fully completed.

Detailed examples:

StopApplication Playbook â StopApplication Playbook shall return control
and a completion status only after VNF application is fully stopped, all
processes/services stopped.
StartApplication Playbook â StartApplication Playbook shall return control
and a completion status only after all VNF application services are fully up,
all processes/services started and ready to provide services. NOTE: Start
Playbook should not be declared complete/done after starting one or several
processes that start the other processes.

HealthCheck Playbook:

SUCCESS â HealthCheck success shall be returned (return code 0) by a
Playbook or Cookbook only when VNF is 100% healthy, ready to take requests
and provide services, with all VNF required capabilities ready to provide
services and with all active and standby resources fully ready with no
open MINOR, MAJOR or CRITICAL alarms.

NOTE: In some cases, a switch may need to be turned on, but a VNF
reported as healthy, should be ready to take service requests or be
already processing service requests successfully.

A successful execution of a health-check playbook shall also create one
file per VNF VM, named after the VNF instance name followed by
"_results.txt (<vnf_instance>_results.txt) to indicate health-check was
executed and completed successfully, example: vfdb9904v_results.txt,
with the following contents:

.. code-block:: java

  {
   "identifier": "VNF",
   "state": "healthy",
   "time": "2018-03-16:1139"
  }

Example:

.. code-block:: java

  $ cat vfdb9904v_results.txt
  {
   "identifier": "VNF",
   "state": "healthy",
   "time": "2018-03-16:1139"
  }
..

FAILURE â A health check playbook shall return a non-zero return code in
case VNF is not 100% healthy because one or more VNF application processes
are stopped or not ready to take service requests or because critical or
non-critical resources are not ready or because there are open MINOR, MAJOR
or CRITICAL traps/alarms or because there are issues with the VNF that
need attention even if they do not impact services provided by the VNF.

A failed health-check playbook shall also create one file per VNF,
named after the VNF instance name, followed by
"_results.txt to indicate health-check was executed and found issues
in the health of the VNF. This is to differentiate from failure to
run health-check playbook or playbook tasks to verify the health of the VNF,
example: vfdb9904v_results.txt, with the following contents:

.. code-block:: java

 {
  "identifier": "VNF",
  "state": "unhealthy",
  "info": "Error in following VM(s). Check hcstatus files
  under /tmp/ccfx9901v for details",
  "fault": [
    "vfdb9904vm001",
    "vfdb9904vm002"
  ],
  "time": "2018-03-16:4044"
 }
..

Example:

.. code-block:: java

 $ cat vfdb9904v_results.txt
 {
  "identifier": "VNF",
  "state": "unhealthy",
  "info": "Error in following VM(s). Check hcstatus files
  under /tmp/ccfx9901v for details",
  "fault": [
    "vfdb9904vm001",
    "vfdb9904vm002"
  ],
  "time": "2018-03-16:4044"
 }
..

See `VNF REST APIs`_ for additional details on HealthCheck.



ONAP Controller / Ansible API Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section outlines the workflow that ONAP Controller invokes when
it receives an action request against an Ansible managed VNF.

 #. When ONAP Controller receives a request for an action for an
    AnsibleManaged VNF, it retrieves the corresponding template (based
    on **action** and **VNF**) from its database and sets necessary
    values (such as an Id, NodeList, and EnvParameters) from either
    information in the request or data obtained from other sources.
    This is referred to as the payload that is sent as a JSON object
    to the Ansible server.
 #. The ONAP Controller sends a request to the Ansible server to
    execute the action.
 #. The ONAP Controller polls the Ansible Server for result (success
    or failure).  The ONAP Controllers has a timeout value which is
    contained in the template.   If the result is not available when the
    timeout is reached, the ONAP Controller stops polling and returns a
    timeout error to the requester.   The Ansible Server continues to
    process the request.

.. [#7.3.2]
   Recall that the Node Object **is required** to be identical across
   all VMs of a VNF invoked as part of the action except for the "name".

.. [#7.3.3]
   Upstream elements must provide the appropriate FQDN in the request to
   ONAP for the desired action.

.. [#7.3.4]
   Multiple ONAP actions may map to one playbook.
