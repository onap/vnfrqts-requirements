Infrastructure Requirements
===========================

This Amsterdam release of the requirements is targeted for those
implementations that consist of Network Clouds: Vanilla OpenStack
(based on Ocata_) and commercial Clouds for example: OpenStack
(including `Titanium - Mitaka from Wind River`_ and
`VIO - Ocata from VMware`_). Future versions of ONAP are
envisioned to include other targeted cloud infrastructure implementations,
for example, on-premise private cloud, public cloud, or hybrid cloud
implementations, and related network backends, e.g. `Microsoft Azure`_ et al.
