PlaybookName,xNF provider must list name of the playbook relative path used to execute the xNF action.,Mandatory,"Currently following Ansible standard naming, where main playbook is always named site.yml, and directory name where this main playbook resides, is named after the command/action playbook performs, in lower case, example, configure."
Action,Name of xNF action.,Optional,
EnvParameters,A JSON dictionary which should list key attribute-value pairs to be passed to the Ansible playbook. These values usually are instance specific parameters that a playbook needs to execute an action targeting the xNF instance.,Optional,"Attribute-value pairs vary from xNF action-to-action.  Targeted xNF instance name is commonly a required attribute.

Attribute names (variable names) passed to Ansible shall follow Ansible valid variable names: ""Variable names should be letters, numbers, and underscores. Variables should always start with a letter."""
NodeList,"xNF inventory xNFC names with respective IP/VIP addresses, in xNFC groups, xNF instance local/site name, and other info required to build inventory hosts file playbook must be executed against.",Optional,"If NodeList is not provided, inventory hosts file must be pre-loaded (xNF) in the Ansible Server in advance of request targeting instance otherwise request fails with inventory hosts file not found."
FileParameters,A JSON dictionary where keys are filenames and values are contents of files. The Ansible Server will utilize this feature to generate files with keys as filenames and values as content. This attribute can be used to generate files that a playbook may require as part of execution.,Optional,Depends on the xNF action and playbook design.

When set to ""VM"" or ""VNFC"" Ansible Server Rest API adds VM names or VNFC names, respectively, to the inventory hosts file besides IP addresses (or FQDNs). Names and IP addresses are provided by APPC/SDN-C in xNF NodeList.",Optional,"This parameter is used by Ansible Server Rest API to build inventory hosts file matching what is required by xNF Type.
