      "message": "Can we simply change this to the VNF or PNF Provider **MUST** provide...  Not every VNF uses a CSAR package (ex: Heat-based VNFs).  I\u0027m ok if we added some some statement at the end that \"If the VNF or PNF is packaged in a CSAR package, then the artifacts MUST be in included in the CSAR\".  Can we provide guidance on where in the CSAR it should be packaged?",

      "message": "Honestly, I think the original requirement should have been on the VNF Provider to begin with as it\u0027s not the VNF that provides the artifacts as they must be delivered via some other process to the operator.  If there\u0027s an issue with the recommendation that I gave, then we could alternatively split it into 2 different requirements... for PNF use the PNF CSAR package for VNFs, then the VNF Provider must provide it.",

We just need to make sure that if we provide separate requirements, that they are worded in such a way that they don\u0027t overlap or cause confusion (i.e. the requirement for Heat-based VNFs must explicitly state that when the requirement applies)",
