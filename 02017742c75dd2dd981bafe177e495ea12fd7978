      "message": "I take your point about 8443 being incorrect in some cases, but I question if we need to even say anything at all about the typical port.  The requirement is for the VES endpoint to be configured by the Service Provider. I don\u0027t see how knowing the port, but not the FQDN of the listener is additive to this spec.  Rather than introduce details that may change in a future ONAP release, could we just remove the sentence entirely?",
